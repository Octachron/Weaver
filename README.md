Weaver is an OCaml framework for writing `html5+css+javascript` presentations. With the omnipresence of internet, html5 is an attractive medium for scientific communication. In particular, recent html5 features, like videos or canvas elements or webgl, are very interesting. 
Weaver implements the plumbing required to transform a declarative html presentation into an interactive presentation with a low amount of OCaml code.
